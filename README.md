# SVM-for-HIV-1-Protease
The objective of this project is to understand the cleavage profile of HIV-1 protease, and predict the peptide sites in humans where it cleaves on to the host. Gaining this understanding can help design drugs which can inhibit the HIV-1 protease from cleaving on to the host.
