# SVM-for-HIV-1-Protease
The objective of this project is to understand the cleavage profile of HIV-1 protease, and predict the peptide sites in humans where it cleaves on to the host. Gaining this understanding can help design drugs which can inhibit the HIV-1 protease from cleaving on to the host.

1. Read the INFO.txt file in the Files Folder to gain an understanding of the problem.
2. The Training and Test data files are also uploaded in the Files Folder. Those need to be read while executing the code.
3. The roc plot uploaded is what should be generated as he output of the code.
